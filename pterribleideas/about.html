<h1>About Us</h1>
<p class="body">At Pterrible Ideas Ltd., we believe the best ideas are the ones that make you say, “Wait… seriously?”<br>And yes—the P in Pterrible is silent… unlike our products.
  As the proud parent company of Screeching Pterodactyl (fearless films), Flying Pterodactyl (wildwear for the bold), and Thirsty Pterodactyl (soda with a screech),
  we specialize in launching outrageously fun brands that soar just outside the realm of ordinary. From fizzy flavors to feathered fashion and prehistoric production, we're here to bring big, bizarre energy to everyday life
  <br>We may not always follow the rules—but when you've got wings, why would you stay on the ground?</p><br><h2 class="tagline">Pterrible Ideas Ltd. - So bad, it's brilliant.</h2>
